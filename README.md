# UVNF - Unity Visual Novel Framework
UVNF is a free Unity framework for creating Visual Novels in Unity.
This repository provides a set of examples, tools, workflows and other resources to help you get started on your project.

Several ways of writing your own visual novels without any programming. Using a writer-friendly node based dialogue editor and a more in depth story editor, you can view your story visually without having to dive into a pogramming language or complex settings.
